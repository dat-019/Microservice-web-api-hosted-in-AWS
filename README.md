## Development Environment - Prerequisites
- Regarding web api development strategy, there are many approached technologies that could be used to develop, such as ASP.NET Core or NoteJS. For this article we choose ASP.NET Core Web API as it is part of MS technology stack.
- MS Visual Studio. At the time of this demo Im using MS Visual Studio 2017.
- As we are working on AWS, [AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio 2017 and 2019](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AmazonWebServices.AWSToolkitforVisualStudio2017) is an essential tool to help us with some pre-defined templates to create a new project for Lambda AWS function (web api with .net core). This also supports to publish the function from local into AWS directly via VS.
- As we are working on microservices and related deciplines, Docker is one of the most powerfully platform supporting this at the moment. We need to install [Docker Desktop on Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) on your Windows local.
